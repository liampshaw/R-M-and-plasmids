Data files are large and stored externally at figshare, and should be downloaded into a `data` directory in this directory to run notebooks: [10.6084/m9.figshare.21923121.v1](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21923121.v1)

By default, all output files (tables and figures) will be date-stamped with the date they are run on e.g. `output-figures/2023-03-29-{file_name}.pdf`.

The correspondence between the manuscript and the notebooks is as follows:
* `01_avoidance_of_palindromes.Rmd` - Avoidance of 6-bp palindromes is stronger in plasmid genes than in core genes.
